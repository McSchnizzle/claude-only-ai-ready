That's excellent context. The 30-year VTM pedigree, 17-year Novus Labs track record, and the fact that you're already actively consulting for organizations like WorkSystems and Free Geek gives you serious credibility. The "reassuring competence" angle is perfect for the market you're targeting.

Let me put together everything you need. This will be comprehensive:

## 5. LOGO PROMPTS FOR GEMINI

**Primary Logo Prompt:**
```
Design a professional, modern logo for "AISupportPDX" — a Portland, Oregon-based AI consulting company. The logo should combine the letters "AI" in a creative monogram with a subtle Pacific Northwest element such as an evergreen tree silhouette, the St. Johns Bridge arch, or Mt. Hood outline. Use a deep forest green (#1B4332) as the primary color with a copper (#B87333) accent. The style should feel established and trustworthy, not startup-y or overly techy. Clean lines, balanced composition, works well at small sizes. No gradients. Transparent background.
```

**Icon/Favicon Prompt:**
```
Design a simple square icon/favicon for "AISupportPDX" that works at 32x32 pixels. Feature a minimalist "AI" lettermark with a single subtle evergreen tree or mountain peak element. Deep forest green (#1B4332) on transparent background. Must be instantly recognizable at small sizes.
```

**Secondary Graphic Element Prompt:**
```
Create a decorative graphic element for AISupportPDX marketing materials: an abstract pattern inspired by Pacific Northwest topography (mountain ridges, tree lines, river curves) rendered in a modern, geometric style. Use deep forest green (#1B4332), soft sage (#A7C4A0), and copper (#B87333) on warm white (#FAF9F6). Should work as a background texture or section divider. Horizontal orientation.
```

## 8. COLD OUTREACH EMAIL CAMPAIGN (4 Emails)

- Goal: Book free December consultation
- Sending cadence: Day 1, Day 4, Day 8, Day 14

---

### EMAIL 1: Introduction (Day 1)

**Subject Line Options:**
- "Quick question about [Company Name]'s 2026 plans"
- "Is AI on your radar for 2026?"
- "Portland business + AI = ?"

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I'm reaching out because [Company Name] came up as I was thinking about Portland businesses that could genuinely benefit from what's happening with AI right now.

Here's the thing: AI has shifted from experimental to practical. Tools exist today that can handle your scheduling, answer customer calls, manage your social media, and streamline workflows you've been doing manually for years — without requiring a technical team to run them.

I lead AISupportPDX, a local consulting practice backed by 30 years of tech leadership through Vital Enterprises. We're helping Portland-area businesses figure out which AI tools actually make sense for them (and which are just hype).

We're offering **free AI readiness consultations through December** — a 30-minute call to identify your top opportunities, no strings attached.

Would you be open to a quick conversation?

Best,
[Your Name]
AISupportPDX
[Phone] | AISupportPDX.com

### EMAIL 2: Value Add (Day 4)

**Subject Line Options:**
- "What a landscaping company taught me about AI"
- "The $500/month question"
- "Re: AI for [Company Name]"

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Following up on my note from earlier this week.

I wanted to share a quick example: we recently helped a local service company automate their scheduling and customer follow-ups. The owner was spending 10+ hours a week on tasks that now run automatically. That's time back for actual work — or just having a life.

The tools to do this aren't expensive or complicated anymore. The hard part is knowing where to start and what's worth your time.

That's exactly what our free December consultations cover:
- Your current tech setup
- 3 highest-impact AI opportunities specific to your business
- A clear recommendation (not a sales pitch)

30 minutes. No cost. No obligation.

Interested?

[Your Name]

---

### EMAIL 3: Credibility + Urgency (Day 8)

**Subject Line Options:**
- "30 years of tech, focused on Portland"
- "Why December matters for AI planning"
- "Last chance to get ahead of 2026"

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

One more note, then I'll leave you alone.

AISupportPDX isn't a startup figuring things out — we're backed by Vital Enterprises, with 30 years leading global technology consortiums through VTM and 17 years of product development through Novus Labs. We've been working with AI since before ChatGPT made it cool.

We're already helping organizations across the region build their AI strategies. Now we're opening up free consultations to local businesses through December — because 2026 is shaping up to be the year AI goes mainstream, and the businesses that prepare now will have an edge.

If getting clarity on AI before year-end sounds useful, I'd love to help.

[Calendar link or "Just reply to this email"]

Best,
[Your Name]

### EMAIL 4: Final / Breakup (Day 14)

**Subject Line Options:**
- "Closing the loop"
- "Not the right time?"
- "Should I stop reaching out?"

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I've reached out a few times about our free AI readiness consultations and haven't heard back — totally understand if the timing isn't right.

I'll leave you with this: if AI feels overwhelming, confusing, or like something "for other businesses," you're not alone. That's exactly why we do what we do.

Whenever you're ready to explore what's possible — whether that's next month or next year — we're here. Just reply to this email or visit AISupportPDX.com.

Wishing you and the [Company Name] team a great end to 2025.
